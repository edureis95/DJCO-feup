# DJCO-feup (To do)


## engine


* double jump from when the player clicks (not only on top)
* player drops when clicking jump from the 2nd plataform without waiting for the time to end
* double jump when falling from the secound floor
* object generation improvement
* becomes harder when the meters increase(faster more objects generated maybe   


## aspect


* show time
* show the time in the player as a subobject (when in the upper plataform), and make effects (like when the time is ending starts to blink)
* new sprites
* music
* music and visual effects when jumping and grabing things
* instead of the barrel use a vending machine or a teacher or a radiator something from feup


## menus    


* simple menu to play
* see last 5 scores (need to be saved and loaded from file)
